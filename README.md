# Internet Illustrated

## AP Studio Art Final Project
The last of my 15 concentration pieces, expanding on my previous JavaScript / Desmos based Project

The goal of this project was to collect images from google and piece them together to create a collage of how the internet views Israel. As my concentration was on the different perceptions of Israel, this piece serves as a final capstone to give an answer to this question from the perspective of the Internet.
